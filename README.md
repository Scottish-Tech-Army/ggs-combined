# GGS-combined README

## Deployment

Run the following command from the `ggs-combined` root directory: `./cdk/bin/install.sh`. You may need to `chmod +x` the script before you are able to run it. The script assumes that you have configured your AWS credentials inside your `~/.aws/credentials` file.

The installation script will install the GGS application to your AWS account.
